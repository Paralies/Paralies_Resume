  Hello, my name is Cheolhee Kim. I've earned my bachelor's degree in Donnguk University and I'm in the course of master's student in Korea University now. 
  I am interested in deep learning, esecially computer vision and learning models.
  Though I am focusing on the deep learning area, I really like to experience the broad area of computer engineering!

          Creating 2D action game using Unity engine. In this project, I developed the 2D action game with platform style, using the assets of the unique art of Dongguk University made by our team. I mainly took charge of developing the game inspired by 'Golfing Over It', entire story direction and sound design.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
